# Works On My Machine

A tool to debug programs by logging which aspects of the environment it depends on.

Just call a program that's giving you trouble with this tool to create a log. Run it on your machine and the machine of your colleague and compare the logs. 

```bash
womm.exe broken_program.exe
```

That's the idea anyway. For now it's only a copy of one of the sample programs in Detour.
